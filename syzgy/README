Here are a few of the scripts from the P2 calculations.  I copied them here to
serve as examples or templates for future work -- they won't run without lusol, e.g.

The directory from the previous calculation is:  ~sgoldstein/syzygy
Other files are on /scratch/sgoldstein and on the CHTC file system.
